## contributing
there are a few things I want to do with this application, as there a few limitations it possesses (e.g., can only calculate two numbers at a time, no keyboard input support) that I would like to fix. if you want to add anything by yourself (although I would prefer we collaborate), submit a pull request and I'll make sure to list you as a contributor on this document.
